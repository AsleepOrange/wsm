# Worn Stencil Maker (WSM)
This program takes an image and generates another image that appears more worn.

- Right now, this program replaces the image, I will make it make another file instead in the future.

## Arguments
- "-d": This enables debug mode, which overlays colors instead of applying transparency. The R and B color channels belong to points and their radius, while the G channel is dedicated to the noise texture.
- "-s": This sets the image black, allowing you to reuse debug mode.
